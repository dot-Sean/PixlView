Ideas for further development:

    * Safe GL usage
    * CLI parameters for interpreting data file. Integrate into debug process. Pretty cool, eh?
    * Alternate drawing implementations
    * Support for more pixel formats (more planar formats etc.)
    * Preset popup should show when current res fits no preset
    * Cursors to zoom in/out, option-click to zoom out
    * Exponential zoom using cursor
    * Export buffer to image file
    * Support export to multiple formats
