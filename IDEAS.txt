Ideas for further development:

    * Safe GL usage
    * CLI parameters for interpreting data file. Integrate into debug process. Pretty cool, eh?
    * Alternate drawing implementations
    * Support for more pixel formats (more planar etc.)
    * Best fit should iterate over the various fitting formats
    * Preset popup should show -- when current res fits no preset
